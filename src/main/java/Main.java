/**
 * <p>The "Multiples of a Number" code challenge found at <a href="https://www.codeeval.com/browse/18/">CodeEval</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * Some thoughts:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>I assumed that "greater or equal" is valid for positive and negative integer values of n, but only positive
 *     integer values of the power of two integer.</li>
 *     <li>I assumed that the goal is to demonstrate the implementation of the fastest algorithm for finding the result,
 *     not to demonstrate the fastest speed to read and process large files. Due to this, the implementation is
 *     performance constrained by disk IO.</li>
 *     <li>I assumed that user friendly error messages, comments, and test code are a non-goal, though I did include a
 *     couple of these.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The algorithm I used can be found at this link on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two#Fast_algorithms_to_round_any_integer_to_a_multiple_of_a_given_power_of_two">Wikipedia</a>.
